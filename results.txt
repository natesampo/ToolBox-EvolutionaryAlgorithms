This Toolbox was a great success and I learned a lot! One issue I noticed with
the finished product was that it takes a very short amount of time to come up
with a string that is very nearly the goal string ('SKYNT S ONLINE' for example,
when 'SKYNET IS ONLINE' was the goal). Typically, it would reach one of these
close strings and never actually develop into the full goal string, even after
500 generations. In order to remedy this, I experimented with altering the number
of generations, and seeing how many were typically required to actually achieve
the full goal string. I also tested changed the goal string to see if shorter
or less complex strings were easier to achieve. I made a small pseudo-table below
with some results:

GOAL STRING:              GENERATIONS TO ACHIEVE:
"SKYNET IS ONLINE"            ~700
"ILL BE BACK"                 ~300
"SARAH CONNOR"                ~150
"ARNOLD"                      ~200
"TERMINATOR"                  ~100
"KYLE REESE"                  ~350
